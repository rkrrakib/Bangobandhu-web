                        <b>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</b>, affectionately known as Bangabandhu, was a pivotal figure in the struggle for independence and the subsequent shaping of Bangladesh. Born on <b>March 17, 1920,</b> in Tungipara, he emerged as a charismatic leader advocating for the rights and identity of the Bengali people within the political landscape of Pakistan.  Bangabandhu's visionary leadership during this turbulent period was instrumental in the birth of Bangladesh as an independent nation. Tragically, he and most of his family were assassinated on <b>August 15, 1975,</b> leaving an indelible mark on the nation's history and a legacy that continues to resonate, inspiring generations to strive for justice, equality, and progress.</p>
